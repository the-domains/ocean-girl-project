  Dan Queiroz Editors Note: This is a guest post from Srinivas Rao ofThe Skool
  of Life... A little over a year ago, I started a spiritual and emotional
  journey that I now realize will last a lifetime. For many this journey is one
  that will forever change who they are and the journey isn't something they do,
  it's who they are.
